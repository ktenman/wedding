            <p>I'm Konstantin Tenman, and I believe your most cherished moments shouldn't just be photographed &mdash; they should be transformed into timeless visual poetry.</p>
            <p>In the soft morning light of your wedding day, in the gentle touch between lovers, in the unguarded moments of pure joy &mdash; this is where real magic lives. I'm here to weave these fleeting seconds into a tapestry of memories that will make your heart skip a beat decades from now.</p>

            <h2>My Photography Philosophy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The poetry of unscripted moments &mdash; those in-between glances that say everything</li>
                <li>Luminous, emotion-driven imagery that feels like stepping into a dream</li>
                <li>A gentle, intuitive approach that allows your true connection to unfold naturally</li>
                <li>The art of finding extraordinary beauty in your ordinary moments</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="journey">
            <p>From the first flutter of excitement as you prepare for your day to the last dance under the stars, I document your wedding with the reverence it deserves. For portraits that celebrate your journey &mdash; engagement, anniversary, or simply because love deserves to be celebrated &mdash; I create a sanctuary where authenticity blooms.</p>
            <p>From my home in Estonia, I partner with souls who understand that photographs are love letters to the future, who crave images that feel as beautiful as their memories, and who trust me to be both their photographer and keeper of moments.</p>
            <p class="closing">Your love story is a masterpiece waiting to unfold. Let me help you tell it.</p>
